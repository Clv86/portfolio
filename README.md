# Portofolio

This project was my web developper portfolio while I was looking for an apprenticeship.
The goal was also to practice React with Typescript, and elaborate a simple design to showcase my beginner skills in vanilla css.

# Configuration

To use the website, install all dependencies :

` npm install`

Then run dev mode : 

` npm run dev `

You can also build the project for production with :

` npm run build `
